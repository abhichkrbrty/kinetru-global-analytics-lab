# Kinetru Global Analytics Lab

A public, research-style analytics lab under **KinetRu / RuruSystems** focused on
**global market data, analytics, and decision-oriented insights**.

This repository is intentionally designed as a **training + contribution lab**
for early collaborators across data, BI, and business strategy roles.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Kinetru Global studies **world equity indices** to understand:

- Market returns and volatility regimes  
- Drawdowns and recovery behavior  
- Cross-market correlations  
- Simple regime / state indicators  
- How analytics can support clearer decisions  

The emphasis is on **clarity, structure, and reproducibility** — not black-box models.
